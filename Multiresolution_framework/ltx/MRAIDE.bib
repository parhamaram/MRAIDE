  abstract = {This paper examines the problem of estimating linear time-invariant
	state-space system models. In particular, it addresses the parametrization
	and numerical robustness concerns that arise in the multivariable
	case. These difficulties are well recognised in the literature, resulting
	(for example) in extensive study of subspace-based techniques, as
	well as recent interest in ?data driven? local co-ordinate approaches
	to gradient search solutions. The paper here proposes a different
	strategy that employs the expectation?maximisation (EM) technique.
	The consequence is an algorithm that is iterative, with associated
	likelihood values that are locally convergent to stationary points
	of the (Gaussian) likelihood function. Furthermore, theoretical and
	empirical evidence presented here establishes additional attractive
	properties such as numerical robustness, avoidance of difficult parametrization
	choices, the ability to naturally and easily estimate non-zero initial
	conditions, and moderate computational cost. Moreover, since the
	methods here are maximum-likelihood based, they have associated known
	and asymptotically optimal statistical properties.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal processes can often be written as hierarchical state-space
	processes.
	
	In situations with complicated dynamics such as wave propagation,
	it is
	
	difficult to parameterize state transition functions for high-dimensional
	state processes.
	
	Although in some cases prior understanding of the physical process
	can be
	
	used to formulate models for the state transition, this is not always
	possible. Alternatively,
	
	for processes where one considers discrete time and continuous space,
	
	complicated dynamics can be modeled by stochastic integro-difference
	equations
	
	in which the associated redistribution kernel is allowed to vary with
	space and/or
	
	time. By considering a spectral implementation of such models, one
	can formulate
	
	a spatio-temporal model with relatively few parameters that can accommodate
	
	complicated dynamics. This approach can be developed in a hierarchical
	framework
	
	for non-Gaussian processes, as demonstrated on cloud intensity data.},
