% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
\usepackage{amssymb}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
% \usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e 
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.
 \ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
\else
  \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\fi


%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper introduces a multiresolution data-driven framework for neural field modeling. Neural field models describe the meso and macroscopic dynamics of the human brain. Modeling the brain at this level is extremely important, since diseases such as epilepsy and \parham{Parkinson's disease} are manifested at this scale through pathological oscillations. The ability to create patient-specific neural field models will not only contribute to our knowledge base of poorly understood diseases such as epilepsy, but may also enable the development of new treatment strategies. This is particularly poignant with the advent of new devices that use therapeutic electrical stimulation. Presently, stimulation strategies for devices using corrective or modulating electrical stimulation operate in an open-loop, where stimulation parameters are chosen using a process of trial and error. Therefore, there exists an enormous potential to improve the performance of these devices using systems theory. The design of a stimulation strategy using systems theory requires a model. Neural mass and neural field models are the ideal candidates for estimation and control algorithms. It is expected that parameters of the neural fields models will be patient specific and will therefore need to be inferred from data.

Creating patient specific neural models has been approached from a number of different standpoints. \dean{need to add proper citations here.} Valdes et al. (1999) used the neural mass model of Lopes Da Silva (1976) and Zetterberg et al. (1978) to fit EEG data. This approach was extended by David and Friston (2003) to coupled neural masses (using the equations of Jansen and Ritt (1995)) through a Bayesian estimation scheme dubbed Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). Following this work, Galka et al. (2008), Sauer et al. (2008), Daunizeau et al. (2009), and Freestone et al (2011) developed the estimation frameworks for continuum neural field equations that explain the richer dynamics of spatiotemporal neural fields.  

This paper is an extension to the framework presented Freestone et al. (2011), where a finite element model of the neural field (via a global Galerkin projection) was formed, using a basis function decomposition, to transform the PDE neural field equations into a finite dimension system to facilitate state and parameter estimation. The basis function decomposition in this previous study did not account for all of the spatial dynamics. Thus, it can be improved.. In this current paper, a multiresolution approach is taken...

By taking the multiresolution approach, the identified IDE model will approximate the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics at different spatial scales. In this way both macroscopic and microscopic behaviour of the system can be represented simultaneously...

\section{Integro-Difference Equation Neural Field Model}
The stochastic integro-difference equation (IDE) form of the Amari neural field  formulation~\cite{Amari1977} is given by (see \dean{cite NeuroImage paper} for a full derivation)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DiscreteTimeModel}
	v_{t+T_s}\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = 
	\xi v_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right) + 
	T_s \int_\Omega { 
	    w\left(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r'}\right)
	    f\left(v_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)\right) 
	\, d\mathbf{r}'} 
	+ e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right), 
\end{equation}
where the post-synaptic membrane voltage at time $t$ of a population of neurons at position $\mathbf r$ is denoted $v_t\left(\mathbf r\right)$. Synaptic dynamics are included through the parameter $\xi=\left(1-\frac{ T_s}{\tau}\right)$, where $\tau$ is the synaptic time constant and $T_s$ is the sampling time. The connectivity strength between neural populations at a distance $\mid\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\mid$ is described by the kernel $w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right)$. The connectivity kernel is taken as a ``Mexican hat'' function, which describes local excitation and lateral inhibition \cite{Amari1977}. The firing rate of the presynaptic neurons is related to the post-synaptic membrane potential by the activation function $f\left(.\right)$. \dean{The activation function is of the form $f(v_t(\mathbf{r})) = \varsigma v_t(\mathbf{r}) + v_0$}. The term $e_t(\mathbf r)$ is an $i.i.d.$ disturbance such that $e_t(\mathbf{s})\sim\mathcal{GP}(\mathbf 0,\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}))$, where $\mathcal{GP}(\mathbf 0,\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}))$  denotes a zero mean spatial Gaussian process with covariance function $\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})$~\cite{Rasmussen2005}. For simplicity, \cut{we denote the current time step by $t$ and the future time step by $t+1$.} The observation equation describing the electrophysiological recordings is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ObservationEquation}
	\mathbf y_t = \int_{\Omega} { m\left(\mathbf{r}_{n_y}-\mathbf{r}'\right) v_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right) \, d\mathbf{r}'} + \boldsymbol\epsilon_t, 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{y}_{t} = [y_t(\mathbf{r}_1) y_t(\mathbf{r}_2) \cdots y_t(\mathbf{r}_{n_y})]^\top$, compiled at $n_{y}$ spatial locations at time $t$ via the observation kernel $m\left(\mathbf{r}_{n_y}-\mathbf{r}'\right)$, is corrupted by an i.i.d normally distributed zero-mean white noise $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}\right)$ with $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}=\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\mathbf I_{n_y} $. The superscript $\top$ denotes the transpose operator.

\section{MRA of the IDE in State-Space}
The multiresolution approximation (MRA) of the neural IDE is obtained by decomposing both the field, $v_t(.)$, and the connectivity kernel, $w(.)$, (assuming square-integrable functions) using translations and dilations of a scaling function $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ and a mother wavelet $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. Considering a one-dimensional field, the connectivity kernel is decomposed by,
\begin{equation}
 w\left(r-r'\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\alpha_{j_0,l}\phi_{j_0,l}\left(r-r'\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\beta_{j,l}\psi_{j,l}\left(r-r'\right), 
\label{eq:KernelExpansion}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{j_0,l}$ are the approximation coefficients at the lowest scale $j_0$, and $\beta_{j,l}$ are the detail coefficients at different scales $j$, with $\phi_{j,l}\left(r\right)=2^{\frac{j}{2}}\phi\left(2^jr-l\right) $ and $\psi_{j,l}\left(r\right)=2^{\frac{j}{2}}\psi\left(2^jr-l\right)$. Integers $j$ and $l$ are the scale and translation parameters respectively. The field is decomposed as
\begin{equation}
 v_t\left(r\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}x_{t,j_{0},l}\phi_{j_{0},l}\left(r\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} \check{x}_{t,j,l}\psi_{j,l}\left(r\right),
\label{eq:FieldExpansion}
\end{equation}
where $ x_{t,j_{0},l}$ and $\check{x}_{t,j,l} $ are the coefficients of the expansion at time $t$.
% A  two-dimensional MRA can be implemented using 2-D scaling and wavelet functions built up  using the tensor-product approach \cite{Meyer1992,Mallat1998}. We write the 2-D scaling function as
% \begin{equation}
%  \phi_{j,\mathbf{l}}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\phi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dscalingfunction}
% \end{equation}
% and three 2-D wavelet functions $ \psi^{(n)} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ where $n=1,2,3$ as
% \begin{equation}
%  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(1)}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\psi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_1}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}

% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_2}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(3)}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\psi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\psi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_3}
% \end{equation}
% for $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and, $\mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^2$, where $\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(1)},  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(2)}$ and $\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(3)} $ extract fine features of the 2-D field at vertical, horizontal and diagonal orientations respectively.
% This can be generalised to $d$-dimensional MRA by introducing the scaling function
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \phi_{j,\mathbf{l}}\left(r_1,r_2, \cdots r_d\right)&=&\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\phi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right) \cdots \phi_{j,l_d}\left(r_d\right) \label{eq:d-dimensionalscalingfunction}\\
%  &&j \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad \mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% and $2^d-1$ wavelet functions $ \psi^{(n)} \left(\mathbf{r}\right), n=1, \cdots,2^d-1$ with a procedure similar to the 2-D case. Using these basis functions, multi-dimensional MRA of the kernel and the field can be obtained by
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  k\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)&=&\sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\alpha_{j_0,\mathbf{l}}\phi_{j_0,\mathbf{l}}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right) \nonumber \\
% &+&\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\sum_{i=1}^{2^d-1}\beta_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)} \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right) 
% \label{eq:MultidimensionalKernelExpansion}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% \begin{equation}
% z_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}x_{t,j_{0},\mathbf{l}}\phi_{j_{0},\mathbf{l}}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\sum_{i=1}^{2^d-1} \check{x}_{t,j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)
% \label{eq:MultidimensionalFieldExpansion}
% \end{equation}
Eqs \eqref{eq:KernelExpansion} and \eqref{eq:FieldExpansion} are infinite series expansions, but  for a practical implementation they must be truncated at some level $j$. Therefore, the field and the connectivity kernel is approximated by
 \begin{align}
 w\left(r-r'\right) &\approx \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(r-r'\right) 
\label{eq:KernelFiniteExpansion} \\
 v_t\left(r\right) &\approx \boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)^\top\mathbf{x}_t,
\label{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion}
\end{align}
where the unknown parameter and state vectors \dean{(block matrices?)}, $\boldsymbol\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\theta}}$ and $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$, are defined as 
\begin{align}
 \boldsymbol\theta^\top &=\left[ \boldsymbol\alpha_{j_0}^\top \quad \boldsymbol\beta_{j_0}^\top \quad \boldsymbol\beta_{j_0+1}^\top \cdots \boldsymbol\beta_{j}^\top\right] 
\label{KernelWeights} \\
 \mathbf{x}_{t}^\top &=\left[\mathbf{x}_{t,j_{0}}^\top \quad  \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j_{0}}^\top \quad  \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j_{0}+1}^\top \cdots \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^\top\right].
\label{FieldWeights}
\end{align}
The kernel and field approximation coefficient vectors $\boldsymbol \alpha_{j_0}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{t,j_{0}}$ contain all the coefficients $\left\lbrace\alpha_{j_0, l}:l \in \mathbb{Z} \right\rbrace $ and $\left\lbrace x_{t,j_0, l}: l \in \mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace$ respectively. Similarly, the kernel and the field detail coefficient vectors, $\boldsymbol\beta_{j}$ and $\check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}$ contain all the coefficients $\left\lbrace \beta_{j,l} :l \in \mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace$ and $\left\lbrace  \check x_{t,j, l}:l \in \mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace$ respectively.

The vectors \dean{(block matrices?)} of the kernel and the field scaling and wavelet functions, $\boldsymbol\lambda$ and $\boldsymbol\mu$ respectively, are defined by
\begin{align}
 \boldsymbol\lambda^\top & (r-r')=\left[ \boldsymbol\phi_{j_0}^\top(r-r') \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0}^\top(r-r') \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0+1}^\top(r-r') \right. \nonumber \\
&\left. \cdots \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j}^\top(r-r')\right] \label{KernelBasisVector} \\
 \boldsymbol\mu^\top & (r)=\left[ \boldsymbol\phi_{j_0}^\top(r) \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0}^\top(r) \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0+1}^\top(r) \cdots \boldsymbol\psi_{j}^\top(r) \right]. 
\label{FieldBasisVector}
\end{align}
The vectors in Eqs. (\ref{KernelBasisVector}) and (\ref{FieldBasisVector}) are constructed in the same manner as the vectors in Eqs. (\ref{KernelWeights}) and (\ref{FieldWeights}). 

To derive the state-space model, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:KernelFiniteExpansion} and \eqref{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion} are substituted into Eq. \eqref{eq:DiscreteTimeModel}, then we cross-multiply by $\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf r\right)$ and integrate over the space giving
\begin{align}\label{eq:DecomposedModel2} 
	&\int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol\mu  \left(r\right)\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)^\top  dr\mathbf{x}_{t+1}= 
	\xi\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)^\top d\mathbf{r}\mathbf{x}_t \nonumber \\
	&+T_s \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right) \int_\Omega { 
	   \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(r-r'\right)
	    \boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(r'\right)\mathbf{x}_t 
	\, dr'd\mathbf{r}} \nonumber \\
	+& \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)e_t\left(r\right)dr.
\end{align}
In order to simplify the model we define the matrices
\begin{align}\label{eq:Lambdax}
 \mathbf{\Lambda}_{x} &\triangleq \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right)\boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(r\right) dr \\
\label{eq:Lambdatheta}
 \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\theta} &\triangleq \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right) \int_\Omega { 
	   \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(r-r'\right)
	    \boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(r\right)\mathbf{x}_t 
	\, dr'dr}
\end{align}
and substitute them into Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecomposedModel2}. Then we cross-multiply by $\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}$ giving
\begin{align}\label{eq:StateEquation}
 \mathbf x_{t+1} &=\mathbf A(\boldsymbol \theta) \mathbf x_t+ \mathbf w_t \\
\label{eq:A_theta}
 \mathbf A(\boldsymbol \theta) &= (T_s\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\theta}+\xi\mathbf I),
\end{align}
where $\mathbf I$ is the identity matrix. The disturbance becomes 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Disturbance}
\mathbf w_t= \mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu \left(\mathbf{r}\right)e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)d\mathbf{r},
\end{equation}
which is a vector valued, zero-mean normally distributed white noise process with covariance (see \cite{Scerri2009} for proof)
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Sigma_w =\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\iint\limits_{\boldsymbol\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(r\right) \eta\left(r-r'\right)\boldsymbol\mu^{\top}\left(r'\right)dr'dr\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-\top}.
\end{equation}
The observation equation of the state-space model is found by substituting decomposition \eqref{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion}
 into equation \eqref{eq:ObservationEquation} giving
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ReducedObservationEquation} 
	\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}_t + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_t,
\end{equation}
where each element of the observation matrix is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{C}_{ij} \triangleq \int_{\Omega}m(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}')\boldsymbol{\mu}_j(\mathbf{r}') \, d\mathbf{r}'.
\end{equation}
This completes derivation of the state-space representation of the multiresolution approximation of the neural field model. 
% \parham{Mike you can add state-space derivation using Galerkin projection here.}

% \section{B-spline wavelet IDE model}
The multiresolution approximation can be implemented using various classes of scaling and wavelet functions. B-spline functions were chosen due their compact support and the ability to analytically calculate convolution and inner product to form the matrices $ \boldsymbol\Lambda_x$ and $\boldsymbol \Lambda_{\theta}$. To show how the matrices are formed, the $m^{th}$ order cardinal B-spline scaling function is defined by the recurrence relation \cite{Chui1992} 
\begin{align}
N_{m}\left(r\right)=&\left(N_{m-1}\ast N_{1}\right)\left(r\right)\nonumber \\
=&\int_0^{1} N_{m-1}\left( r-r'\right)dr' \quad m>1,
\label{SplineConvolutionIntegral}
\end{align}
where $\ast$ denotes convolution and $N_1\left(s\right)$ is the characteristic function of the unit interval $\left[ 0,1\right)$
\begin{equation}
N_{1}\left(r\right)=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $ 0\le r<1$}, \\
0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Eq.~\ref{SplineConvolutionIntegral} can be rewritten as $(m-1)$ times convolution of indicator function with itself since
\begin{equation}
 N_{m}\left(r\right)=\underbrace{\left(N_{1}\ast N_{1}\ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}_{m-1\quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right).
\end{equation}
Using the associativity property of convolution we have
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
\begin{align}\label{eq:BsplineConvolution}
N_{m}\left( r\right) \ast N_{m'}\left(r\right)&=\underbrace{\overbrace{\left(N_{1} \ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}^{m-1 \quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right) \ast \overbrace{\left(N_{1} \ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}^{m'-1\quad \text{convolutions}}}_{m+m'-1 \quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right)\nonumber\\
&=N_{m+m'}\left(r\right).
\end{align}
A direct consequence of Eq.~\eqref{eq:BsplineConvolution} is (see \cite{Chui1992} for proof) 
\begin{align}
 \left\langle N_{m}\left(r-l_{1}\right), N_{m'}\left(r-l_{2}\right)\right\rangle=&N_{m+m'}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right)\nonumber \\
=&N_{m+m'}\left(m'+l_{2}-l_{1}\right),
\label{eq:BsplineInnerProduct}
\end{align}
where $\left\langle \cdot,\cdot\right\rangle $ denotes the inner product. The $m^{th}$ order compactly supported \dean{(is there a non-compactly supported B-spline?)} B-spline wavelet function is defined as (see \cite{Chui1992}) 
\begin{align}
 \varphi & _{m}\left(r\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{3m-2} q_n N_{m}\left(2r-n\right) \\
 q & _n = \frac{\left(-1\right)^n}{2^{m-1}} \sum_{l=0}^{m} \binom{m}{l} N_{2m}\left(n-l+1\right), \,  \text{ $0\le n\le 3m-2$},
\end{align}
where $q_n$ are the coefficients. By exploiting properties Eqs.~\ref{eq:BsplineConvolution} and \ref{eq:BsplineInnerProduct} the integrals in Eqs.~\ref{eq:Lambdax} and \ref{eq:Lambdatheta} can be computed. In order to calculate elements of $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}$ and $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\theta}$ the scaling and wavelet basis functions must be expanded in terms of $N_m$ at the appropriate scale.  In this paper $4^{th}$ order cardinal B-spline scaling and wavelet functions are used. Therefore, the $8^{th}$ and $12^{th}$ order B-spline values at integer points are required (see \cite{Goswami1999}) to compute the integrals in Eqs.~\ref{eq:Lambdax} and \ref{eq:Lambdatheta}.

\section{State and Parameter Estimation}
The state-space representation allows the use of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm \cite{Dempster1977,Shumway2000} to infer both the kernel and the field from the electrophysiological data. The EM algorithm is a two-part iterative algorithm that yields the maximum likelihood estimate of the connectivity kernel parameters (M-step) and the posterior distribution of the field weights (E-step). The M-step finds an estimate of $\boldsymbol\theta$ that maximizes the lower bound, $\mathcal{Q}\left(\boldsymbol\theta,\boldsymbol\theta'\right)$, of the complete-data log-likelihood,  $p\left(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y} \mid \boldsymbol\theta \right)$. The E-step uses the estimate of $\boldsymbol\theta$, $\boldsymbol\theta'$ and the Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother \cite{Gibsona2005} to estimate the posterior state sequence. In this paper we use a standard EM methodology. Therefore, we only describe aspects of the algorithm that are specific to MRA neural field equations due to the space limitations. The bound on the log-likelihood is a quadratic in the form of
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal Q\left(\boldsymbol \theta,\boldsymbol\theta'\right)=\beta+2T_s\left(\boldsymbol\upsilon_0-\boldsymbol\upsilon_1\right)\boldsymbol\theta-T_s\boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\Upsilon\boldsymbol\theta,
\end{equation}
with a maximum at
\begin{align}
 \boldsymbol \theta= \boldsymbol\Upsilon^{-\top}(\boldsymbol\upsilon_0^\top-\boldsymbol\upsilon_1^\top),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq:upsilon0}
 \boldsymbol\upsilon_0&=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n_x}[\boldsymbol\Xi_0]_{i,j}[\Sigma_{w}^{-1}\boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}^{-1}\mathbf U]_{j,i}\\ 
 \boldsymbol\upsilon_1&=\xi\sum_{i,j=1}^{n_x}[\boldsymbol\Xi_1]_{i,j}[\Sigma_{w}^{-1}\boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}^{-1}\mathbf U]_{j,i}\label{eq:upsilon1} \\
 \boldsymbol\Upsilon&=T_s\sum_{i,j=1}^{n_x}[\boldsymbol\Xi_1]_{i,j}[\mathbf{U}^{\mathsf T} \boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}^{-1}\Sigma_{w}^{-1}\boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}^{-1}\mathbf{U}]_{j,i}\label{eq:Upsilon}.
\end{align}
The $\left(i,j\right)^{th}$ element of the block matrix $\mathbf U_{n_x \times n_x}$ is given by
\begin{align}
\left[ \mathbf U\right] _{i,j}&=\int_{\boldsymbol \Omega}\left[\mu(r) \right]_i \left[\int_{\boldsymbol\Omega} \boldsymbol\mu\left(r'\right)\boldsymbol \lambda^\top \left(\mathbf{r-r'}\right) dr'\right]_{j:} dr.
\end{align}
where $[.]_{j:} $ denotes $j^{th}$ row of the matrix. The second terms in Eqs. \ref{eq:upsilon0}, \ref{eq:upsilon1}, and \ref{eq:Upsilon} can be computed as a once-off before the commencement of the EM iterations, which increases the speed of the M-step significantly compared to the method in \cite{Dewar2009}. $\Xi$-variables are calculated using the smoother outputs, i.e., state estimates, $\hat{\mathbf x}_t$ along with their covariance matrix, $\mathbf P_t$, and the cross-covariance matrix $\mathbf M_t$ using \cite{Gibsona2005}
\begin{align}\label{eq:Xivariables}
\boldsymbol\Xi_0&=\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\left(\mathbf M_{t+1}+\mathbf{\hat x}_t\mathbf{\hat x}_{t+1}^\top\right) \\
 \boldsymbol\Xi_1&=\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\left(\mathbf P_t+\mathbf{\hat x}_t\mathbf{\hat x}_t^\top\right).
\end{align}

\section{Results}
To demonstrate the performance of the MRA estimation framework, data was generated synthetically  using Eqs.~\ref{eq:DiscreteTimeModel} and \ref{eq:ObservationEquation}, enabling a comparison between true and estimated parameters. 100 realizations of 1 second of data were generated with an initial condition of $\boldsymbol\Sigma_v=0.1 \times \mathbf{I}_{n_y}$ and $\eta(r-r')=1\times\phi_{4,3,-2}(r-r')$. The sampling period and the synaptic time constant were set to $T_s = 1$~ms and $\tau = 10$~ms respectively. The distance between adjacent sensors was $0.5$~mm resulting into 161 observations. The observation kernel width was set to \dean{?}, providing a width of 0.8 mm at half the maximum amplitude of the observation kernel, allowing for some cross talk in the recordings. The actual connectivity kernel and its decomposition are plotted in \figurename{\ref{fig:KernelAndFreqResponse}} (a). 

The spatial frequency of the observed field is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:KernelAndFreqResponse}} (b). The observed field has an approximate spatial bandwidth $1.38$ cycles/mm. This suggests the use of wavelets up to level $j=3$ \dean{since... why?}. 

Field reconstruction \dean{using the results of the EM algorithm} at different levels of approximations is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:FieldEstimates}}. \dean{Needs more info.} The figure confirms that $j=3$ is adequate to capture the dynamic of the underlying field \dean{since the error converges?}. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the field estimates is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:RMSE}}. 

The histogram in \figurename{\ref{fig:ParametersHistogram}} demonstrates the performance of the parameter estimation. \dean{The results are good because the RMSE between the true and estimated kernels is $1.83$ (units?)... There is a bias of 7.4 \% in $\theta_1$ because..., which is not big deal.}

\section{Discussion}
Some discussion points
\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief summary of the novel aspects
	\item Discuss how we are improving the previous work
	\item Discuss heterogeneity and time delays (at larger spatial scales) and homogeneity (at smaller scales) 
	\item Discuss assumptions, limitations and future work
\end{itemize}


% In order to estimate the spatial mixing kernel and the spatio-temporal field, the  kernel and the field are decomposed using
% Note that the number of translation operations depends on the spatial range of the data. It follows that the total number of terms in (\ref{1DKernelDecompositionForSimulation}) and (\ref{1DFieldDecompositionForSimulation}) are 8 and 47 respectively. The estimated kernel in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate} } is obtained for the cubic B-spline, with initial scale 0 and maximum scale 1. The EM algorithm is allowed to run for 30 iterations to avoid any issues regarding early stopping, though typically the change in $\parallel \mathbf{A} \parallel_{F}$ falls below $10^{-4} $ after less than 15 iterations. A total number of 500 estimation experiments are performed, where $v_t$ and $w_t$ are re-generated each trial.


%  The performance measure employed here is the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) defined as
% \begin{equation}
%  \mathbf{E}\left[\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right) \right]^2ds  \right]
% \label{MISE} 
% \end{equation}
%  where  $e\left(s\right)$ is the error between the unknown function, $f\left( s\right) $ and its estimate, $\hat{f}\left( s\right) $. In this example the original kernel and the field are known and hence the integral in  (\ref{MISE}) can be computed analytically. For spatial mixing kernel we have
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  \lefteqn{\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right)\right]^2ds}\nonumber \\  &=\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)^\top\left[ \int_{\mathcal{S}}\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s\right)\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s\right)^\top ds\right] \left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)&
% \label{MISEKernel}
% \end{eqnarray}
%   Here, we are particularly interested in assessing the performance improvement as the scale of the details in MRA is increased. Performance based on (\ref{MISEKernel}) at different spatial scales and over 500 trials have been evaluated. The MISE of the model at $j=0$ is 0.024 and reduces to 0.005 when $\psi_{4;1,k}$ terms are also included in the model, in fact estimation performance is improved by a factor of 4.8. The coarsest approximation of the kernel along with its approximation at $j=1$ are illustrated in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate}. It can be seen that the model is able to estimate both slowly and rapidly varying segments of the  kernel with very high accuracy.  Field estimates  at a selection of time instants are shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:1DFieldEstimation}}. It is clearly observed that the coarse and fine features of the original field have been captured accurately over regions where observations are available. Observation locations are generated randomly, as shown in \figurename{ \ref{fig:FieldVariance}}. Assuming the observed field can be fully described by the  decomposed IDE model, the variance of the field can be computed to express the  uncertainty of the estimation, at each point in space and at time $t$ we have 
% \begin{equation}
%  \text{Var}(\hat z_t(s_i))=\boldsymbol\mu^{\top}(s_i) \mathbf P_{t|T}\boldsymbol\mu(s_i)
% \label{eq:FieldVariance}
% \end{equation}
% where $\mathbf P_{t|T} $ is the covariance matrix associated with the  state estimates obtained from the RTS smoother. Variance based on (\ref{eq:FieldVariance}) at each spatial location and at $t=50$ is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:FieldVariance}}. The uncertainty of the estimation is higher at almost  every spatial location at $j=1$ compared to $j=0$. This is to be expected as there are more wavelet basis functions at higher resolution and hence more associated weights need to be estimated. Peaks in the variance of the field coincide with regions where no observations have been made. Increasing the number of observation locations, or using equally spaced observation locations would reduce the variance of the field estimation.

% \section{Conclusion}
% A multi-resolution approach to modelling spatio-temporal systems has been presented. This model is able to represent continuous-space, discrete-time dynamics at a number of spatial scales simultaneously. This ability greatly extends the class of system which the Integro-Difference Equation can represent.
%

% By decomposing both the spatial field and the spatial mixing kernel using a wavelet decomposition, it becomes possible to represent small scale details in the field at the same time as large scale details. This is an essential component of any practical spatio-temporal model, without which the model must be artificially separated into global and local modes a-priori.
% 
% 
% The complexity of the model is not affected by the spatial resolution of the observation process, rather it reflects the underlying complexity of the system under study. Therefore, increasing the resolution at which the system is observed does not necessarily increase the complexity of the system identification problem. However the developed algorithm is sensitive to the state dimension, equivalent to the detail represented in the field, and hence intelligent approaches to reduce the number of basis functions is noted as future work. 
% 
% By considering different levels of decomposition, the proposed approach could be used as a method of determining the appropriate scales of decomposition, within a model-selection framework. Combined with an approach to sparsely modelling spatial heterogeneity, such as boundary conditions, this would allow the application of this work to a real-world data set.

% \begin{lemma}
% Let $N_m\left(s-l_1\right)$ and $N_{m'}\left(s-l_2\right)$ be shifted B-spline functions of order $m$ and $m'$ respectively. Then the inner product of  $N_m\left(s-l_1\right)$  and $N_{m'}\left(s-l_2\right)$ can be calculated by 
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \left\langle N_{m}\left(s-l_{1}\right), N_{m'}\left(s-l_{2}\right)\right\rangle&=&N_{m+m'}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right) \nonumber \\
% &=&N_{m+m'}\left(m'+l_{2}-l_{1}\right) 
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% \label{lemma:InProduct}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{IEEEproof}
% The support of $N_m\left(s\right)$ is $\left[ 0,m\right]$ and  is symmetric with respect to $s=\frac{m}{2}$, i.e.
% \begin{equation}
%  N_{m}\left(\frac{m}{2}+s\right)=N_{m}\left(\frac{m}{2}-s\right)
% \label{SymmetrySplieEq}
% \end{equation}
% A direct consequence of (\ref{SymmetrySplieEq}) is 
% \begin{equation}
%  N_{m}\left(s\right)=N_{m}\left(m-s\right)
% \end{equation}
% Therefore
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}
% \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}N_{m}\left(s-l_{1}\right)N_{m'}\left(s-l_{2}\right)ds \nonumber \\
% \qquad=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}N_{m}\left(m-s+l_{1}\right)N_{m'}\left(s-l_{2}\right)ds \nonumber \\
% \qquad=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}N_{m}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}-u\right)N_{m'}\left(u\right)du \nonumber \\
% \qquad=\left(N_m \ast N_m'\right) \left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right) \nonumber \\
% \qquad=N_{m+m'}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right) \nonumber \\
% \qquad=N_{m+m'}\left(m'+l_{2}-l_{1}\right) \nonumber
