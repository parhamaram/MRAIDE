% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
\usepackage{amssymb}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
% \usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e 
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.
 \ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
\else
  \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\fi


%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
% The Integro Difference Equation (IDE) is an increasingly popular model of spatio-temporal processes. Here we develop a Multiresolution Approximation (MRA) framework for the IDE based on semi-orthogonal cardinal B-spline wavelets. State and parameter estimation is approached in a Maximum Likelihood (ML) framework using the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Examples are given to demonstrate the features of the model.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.
\section{Integro-Difference Equation Neural Field Model}
The stochastic  integro-difference equation (IDE) form of the model based on the Wilson-Cowan \cite{Wilson1973} or Amari neural field \cite{Amari1977} formulation is given by (cite NeuroImage paper)
\begin{equation}
	v_{t+T_s}\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = 
	\xi v_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right) + 
	T_s \int_\Omega { 
	    w\left(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r'}\right)
	    f\left(v_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)\right) 
	\, d\mathbf{r}'} 
	+ e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right), 
\end{equation}
where the local post-synaptic membrane voltage at time $t$ of a population of neurons at position $\mathbf r$ is denoted $v_t\left(\mathbf r\right)$, parameter $\xi=\left(1-\frac{ T_s}{\tau}\right)$ where $\tau$ is the synaptic time constant and $T_s$ is the sampling time. The spatial connectivity between neural populations at a distance $\mid\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\mid$ is described by the connectivity kernel $w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right)$, for an isotropic and homogeneous neural field. The connectivity kernel is typically a ``Mexican hat'' function, which describes local excitation and lateral inhibition \cite{Amari1977}. The firing rate of the presynaptic neurons is related to the post-synaptic membrane potential by the sigmoidal activation function $f\left(.\right)$. The term $e_t(\mathbf r)$ is an $i.i.d.$ disturbance such that $e_t(\mathbf{s})\sim\mathcal{GP}(\mathbf 0,\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}))$, where $\mathcal{GP}(\mathbf 0,\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}))$  denotes a zero mean spatial Gaussian process with covariance function $\eta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})$~\cite{Rasmussen2005}. For simplicity, we denote hereafter the current time step by $t$ and the future time step by $t+1$. Here we assume that the sigmoid activation function, $f(\cdot)$, can be approximated by the piecewise function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PiecewiseSigmoid} 
	\hat{f}(v_t(\mathbf{r}')) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0, & v_t(\mathbf{r}') \le v_1 \\
		\varsigma v_t(\mathbf{r}'), &  v_1 < v_t(\mathbf{r}') < v_2 \\
		1, & v_t(\mathbf{r}') \ge v_2 \\ 
		\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
where the parameter $\varsigma$ governs the slope of the sigmoid. Furthermore, we assume the field is in the linear region of the piecewise function giving
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DiscreteTimeModel} 
	v_{t+1}\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = 
	\xi v_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right) + 
	T_s \int_\Omega { 
	    w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)
	    v_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right) 
	\, d\mathbf{r}'} 
	+ e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right), 
\end{equation}
Note that the parameter $\varsigma$ is absorbed into the kernel for simplicity. Observation equation is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ObservationEquation}
	\mathbf y_t = \int_{\Omega} { m\left(\mathbf{r}_{n_y}-\mathbf{r}'\right) v_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right) \, d\mathbf{r}'} + \boldsymbol\epsilon_t, 
\end{equation}
where electrophysiological recordings $\mathbf{y}_{t}=[y_t(\mathbf{r}_1) y_t(\mathbf{r}_2)\cdots y_t(\mathbf{r}_{n_y})]^\top$, compiled at $n_{y}$ spatial locations and at time $t$ via the observation kernel  $m\left(\mathbf{r}_{n_y}-\mathbf{r}'\right)$, is corrupted by an i.i.d normally distributed zero-mean white noise $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}\right)$ with $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}=\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\mathbf I_{n_y} $. The superscript $\top$ denotes the transpose operator.
\section{MRA of the IDE in State-Space}
Assuming $v_t(.)$ and $w(.)$ are square-integrable functions, MRA of the one-dimensional IDE can be obtained by expanding  both the field and the kernel in the equation (\ref{eq:DiscreteTimeModel}) in terms of the translations and dilations of a scaling function $\phi(r)$ and a mother wavelet $\psi(r)$. For the one-dimensional kernel this is given by,
\begin{equation}
 w\left(r-r'\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\alpha_{j_0,l}\phi_{j_0,l}\left(r-r'\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\beta_{j,l}\psi_{j,l}\left(r-r'\right) 
\label{eq:KernelExpansion}
\end{equation}
In this expansion, $\alpha_{j_0,l}$ are the approximation coefficients at the lowest scale $j_0$ and $ \beta_{j,l}$ represent the detail coefficients at different scales $j$, with $\phi_{j,l}\left(r\right)=2^{\frac{j}{2}}\phi\left(2^jr-l\right) $ and $\psi_{j,l}\left(r\right)=2^{\frac{j}{2}}\psi\left(2^jr-l\right)$. Integers $j$ and $l$ are called scale and translation parameters accordingly. The one-dimensional field can similarly be decomposed as
\begin{equation}
 v_t\left(r\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}x_{t,j_{0},l}\phi_{j_{0},l}\left(r\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} \check{x}_{t,j,l}\psi_{j,l}\left(r\right)
\label{eq:FieldExpansion}
\end{equation}
where $ x_{t,j_{0},l}$ and $\check{x}_{t,j,l} $ are the coefficients of the expansion at time $t$.
% A  two-dimensional MRA can be implemented using 2-D scaling and wavelet functions built up  using the tensor-product approach \cite{Meyer1992,Mallat1998}. We write the 2-D scaling function as
% \begin{equation}
%  \phi_{j,\mathbf{l}}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\phi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dscalingfunction}
% \end{equation}
% and three 2-D wavelet functions $ \psi^{(n)} \left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ where $n=1,2,3$ as
% \begin{equation}
%  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(1)}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\psi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_1}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(2)}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\psi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\phi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_2}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(3)}\left(r_1,r_2\right)=\psi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\psi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right)
% \label{eq:2Dwavelet_3}
% \end{equation}
% for $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and, $\mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^2$, where $\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(1)},  \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(2)}$ and $\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(3)} $ extract fine features of the 2-D field at vertical, horizontal and diagonal orientations respectively.
% This can be generalised to $d$-dimensional MRA by introducing the scaling function
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \phi_{j,\mathbf{l}}\left(r_1,r_2, \cdots r_d\right)&=&\phi_{j,l_1}\left(r_1\right)\phi_{j,l_2}\left(r_2\right) \cdots \phi_{j,l_d}\left(r_d\right) \label{eq:d-dimensionalscalingfunction}\\
%  &&j \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad \mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% and $2^d-1$ wavelet functions $ \psi^{(n)} \left(\mathbf{r}\right), n=1, \cdots,2^d-1$ with a procedure similar to the 2-D case. Using these basis functions, multi-dimensional MRA of the kernel and the field can be obtained by
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  k\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)&=&\sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\alpha_{j_0,\mathbf{l}}\phi_{j_0,\mathbf{l}}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right) \nonumber \\
% &+&\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\sum_{i=1}^{2^d-1}\beta_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)} \psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right) 
% \label{eq:MultidimensionalKernelExpansion}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% \begin{equation}
% z_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}x_{t,j_{0},\mathbf{l}}\phi_{j_{0},\mathbf{l}}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)+\sum_{j\geq j_0}^{\infty} \sum_{\mathbf{l}\in \mathbb{Z}^d}\sum_{i=1}^{2^d-1} \check{x}_{t,j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\psi_{j,\mathbf{l}}^{(i)}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)
% \label{eq:MultidimensionalFieldExpansion}
% \end{equation}
Equations \eqref{eq:KernelExpansion} and \eqref{eq:FieldExpansion} are infinite series expansions. For practical implementation,  \eqref{eq:KernelExpansion} and \eqref{eq:FieldExpansion} must be truncated at some level $j$, therefore we have
 \begin{equation}
 w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)\approx \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)
\label{eq:KernelFiniteExpansion}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 v_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\approx\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)^\top\mathbf{x}_t
\label{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion}
\end{equation}
where the unknown parameter vector $ \boldsymbol\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\theta}}$ and the unknown state vector $ \mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ are defined as 
\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol\theta^\top=\left[ \boldsymbol\alpha_{j_0}^\top \quad \boldsymbol\beta_{j_0}^\top \quad \boldsymbol\beta_{j_0+1}^\top \cdots \boldsymbol\beta_{j}^\top\right] 
\label{KernelWeights}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{x}_{t}^\top=\left[\mathbf{x}_{t,j_{0}}^\top \quad  \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j_{0}}^\top \quad  \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j_{0}+1}^\top \cdots \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^\top\right] 
\label{FieldWeights}
\end{equation}
and where the kernel approximation coefficient vector $\boldsymbol \alpha_{j_0}$  and the field approximation coefficient vector $\mathbf{x}_{t,j_{0}}$ comprise all the coefficients $\left\lbrace\alpha_{j_0,\mathbf l}:\mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \right\rbrace $ and $\left\lbrace x_{t,j_0,\mathbf l}: \mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d\right\rbrace$ respectively. The kernel detail coefficient vectors $\boldsymbol \beta_{j}$ and the field detail coefficient vectors $\check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}$ are defined by
\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol\beta_{j}^\top=\left[\boldsymbol\beta_{j}^{(1)\top} \quad \boldsymbol\beta_{j}^{(2)\top} \cdots \boldsymbol\beta_{j}^{(2^d-1)\top}\right] 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^\top=\left[\check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^{(1)\top} \quad \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^{(2)\top} \cdots \check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^{(2^d-1)\top}\right] 
\end{equation}
where the vector $\boldsymbol\beta_{j}^{(i)}$ contains all the coefficient $\left\lbrace \beta_{j,\mathbf l}^{(i)} :\mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d\right\rbrace$ and the vector $\check{\mathbf{x}}_{t,j}^{(i)}$ contains all the coefficient $\left\lbrace  \check x_{t,j,\mathbf l}^{(i)}:\mathbf{l} \in \mathbb{Z}^d\right\rbrace$. 
%and  $\boldsymbol\lambda(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{r})$ is the vector of the kernel scaling and wavelet functions and   $\boldsymbol\mu(\mathbf{s})$ is the vector of the field scaling and wavelet functions. 
 The vector of the kernel scaling and wavelet functions $\boldsymbol\lambda: \mathbb{R}^{n_{\mathcal S}}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_{\theta}}$ and the vector of the field scaling and wavelet functions $\boldsymbol\mu: \mathbb{R}^{n_{\mathcal S}}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ are defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
 \boldsymbol\lambda^\top(\mathbf r-\mathbf r')&=&\left[ \boldsymbol\phi_{j_0}^\top(\mathbf r-\mathbf r') \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0}^\top(\mathbf r-\mathbf r') \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0+1}^\top(\mathbf r-\mathbf r') \right. \nonumber \\
&&\left. \cdots \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j}^\top(\mathbf s-\mathbf r)\right]
\label{KernelBasisVector} 
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol\mu^\top(\mathbf r)=\left[ \boldsymbol\phi_{j_0}^\top(\mathbf r) \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0}^\top(\mathbf r) \quad \boldsymbol\psi_{j_0+1}^\top(\mathbf r) \cdots \boldsymbol\psi_{j}^\top(\mathbf r) \right] 
\label{FieldBasisVector}
\end{equation}
Each vector of basis functions on the right hand-side of (\ref{KernelBasisVector}) and (\ref{FieldBasisVector}) are constructed in a way similar to their corresponding weight vectors in (\ref{KernelWeights}) and (\ref{FieldWeights}). 
% Note that the identified IDE model will approximate the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics at different spatial scales. In this way both macroscopic and microscopic behaviour of the system can be represented simultaneously. 

To derive the state-space representation of the model we substitute decompositions \eqref{eq:KernelFiniteExpansion} and \eqref{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion} into equation \eqref{eq:DiscreteTimeModel} and then cross-multiply the decomposed model by $\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf r\right)$ and integrate over the spatial domain, $\Omega$, giving
\begin{align}\label{eq:DecomposedModel2} 
	&\int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol\mu  \left(\mathbf{r}\right)\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)^\top  d\mathbf{r}\mathbf{x}_{t+1}= 
	\xi\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)^\top d\mathbf{r}\mathbf{x}_t \nonumber \\
	&+T_s \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \int_\Omega { 
	   \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)
	    \boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(\mathbf{r'}\right)\mathbf{x}_t 
	\, d\mathbf{r}'d\mathbf{r}}
	+ \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)d\mathbf{r}, 
\end{align}
Now defning 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lambdax}
 \mathbf{\Lambda}_{x} \triangleq \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(\mathbf{r}\right) d\mathbf{r}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lambdatheta}
 \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\theta}\triangleq\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \int_\Omega { 
	   \boldsymbol\theta^\top\boldsymbol\lambda\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)
	    \boldsymbol\mu^\top\left(\mathbf{r'}\right)\mathbf{x}_t 
	\, d\mathbf{r}'d\mathbf{r}}
\end{equation}
and substituting these into \eqref{eq:DecomposedModel2} and cross-multiplying by $\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}$ yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:StateEquation}
 \mathbf x_{t+1}=\mathbf A(\boldsymbol \theta) \mathbf x_t+ \mathbf w_t
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:A_theta}
 \mathbf A(\boldsymbol \theta)=(T_s\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\theta}+\xi\mathbf I)
\end{equation}
and $\mathbf I$ is the identity matrix, and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Disturbance}
\mathbf w_t= \mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu \left(\mathbf{r}\right)e_t\left(\mathbf{r}\right)d\mathbf{r}
\end{equation}
which is a vector valued, zero-mean normally distributed white noise process with covariance \cite{Scerri2009}
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Sigma_w =\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-1}\iint\limits_{\boldsymbol\Omega}\boldsymbol\mu\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\eta\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\right)\boldsymbol\mu^{\top}\left(\mathbf{r'}\right)d\mathbf{r'}d\mathbf{r}\mathbf{\Lambda}_{x}^{-\top}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, the observation equation of the state-space model is found by substituting decomposition \eqref{eq:FieldFiniteExpansion}
 into equation \eqref{eq:ObservationEquation} giving
\begin{equation}\label{ObservationEquation} 
	\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}_t + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_t,
\end{equation}
where each element of the observation matrix is 
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{C}_{ij} \triangleq \int_{\Omega}m(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}')\boldsymbol{\mu}_j(\mathbf{r}') \, d\mathbf{r}'.
\end{equation}
This completes the state-space representation of the multiresolution approximation of the neural field model.

\section{B-spline wavelet IDE model}
Multiresolution approximation can be implemented using different classes of scaling and wavelet functions. In order to determine the matrices $ \boldsymbol\Lambda_x$ and $\boldsymbol \Lambda_{\theta}$ convolution and inner product expressions of the basis functions need to be computable. B-spline wavelet and scaling functions are particularly convenient in the above decomposition as their convolution and inner product expressions can be found analytically.

The  $m$th order cardinal B-spline scaling function is defined by the recurrence relation \cite{Chui1992} 
\begin{eqnarray}
N_{m}\left(s\right)&=&\left(N_{m-1}\ast N_{1}\right)\left(s\right)\nonumber \\
&=&\int_0^{1} N_{m-1}\left( s-r\right)dr \quad m>1 
\label{SplineConvolutionIntegral}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\ast$ denotes the convolution operator and $N_1\left(s\right)$ is the characteristic function of the unit interval  $\left[ 0,1\right) $
\begin{equation}
N_{1}\left(s\right)=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $ 0\le s<1$}, \\
0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In order to compute the  integrals (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral1}) and (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral2}) we need to be able to calculate the convolution and inner product of B-spline scaling functions. Equation (\ref{SplineConvolutionIntegral}) can be rewritten as $(m-1)$ times convolution of indicator function with itself 
\begin{equation}
 N_{m}\left(r\right)=\underbrace{\left(N_{1}\ast N_{1}\ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}_{m-1\quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right)
\end{equation}
then by using the associativity property of the convolution operator, it is clear that
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
\begin{align}\label{eq:BsplineConvolution}
N_{m}\left( r\right) \ast N_{m'}\left(r\right)&=\underbrace{\overbrace{\left(N_{1} \ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}^{m-1 \quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right) \ast \overbrace{\left(N_{1} \ast \cdots \ast N_{1}\right)}^{m'-1\quad \text{convolutions}}}_{m+m'-1 \quad \text{convolutions}}\left(r\right)\nonumber\\
&=N_{m+m'}\left(r\right)
\end{align}
A direct consequence of \eqref{eq:BsplineConvolution} is \cite{Chui1992} 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left\langle N_{m}\left(r-l_{1}\right), N_{m'}\left(r-l_{2}\right)\right\rangle&=&N_{m+m'}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right)\nonumber \\
&=&N_{m+m'}\left(m'+l_{2}-l_{1}\right)
\label{eq:BsplineInnerProduct}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\left\langle  .,.\right\rangle $ denotes the inner product.


The $m$th order compactly supported B-spline wavelet function is defined as \cite{Chui1992} 
\begin{equation}
 \varphi_{m}\left(s\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{3m-2} q_n N_{m}\left(2s-n\right)
\end{equation}
with the coefficients given by:\\ 
\begin{equation}
 q_n= \frac{\left(-1\right)^n}{2^{m-1}} \sum_{l=0}^{m} \binom{m}{l} N_{2m}\left(n-l+1\right) \quad \text{ $0\le n\le 3m-2$}
\end{equation}


By exploiting properties (\ref{eq:BsplineConvolution}) and (\ref{eq:BsplineInnerProduct}) the  integrals (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral1}) and (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral2}) can be computed. In order to calculate elements of $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{x}$ and $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\theta}$, scaling and wavelet basis functions should be expanded  in terms of $N_m$ at the appropriate scale. It is important to note that B-spline scaling and wavelet functions possess the following orthogonality properties \cite{Unser1993}: 
\begin{equation}
 \left\langle \psi_{m;j_1,l_1}(s),\psi_{m;j_2,l_2}(s)\right\rangle =0  \quad \mathrm{for} \quad j_1\neq j_2
\label{PsiPsiOrthogonality}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \left\langle \phi_{m;j_1,l_1}(s),\psi_{m;j_2,l_2}(s)\right\rangle =0  \quad \mathrm{for} \quad j_1\leq j_2
\label{PhiPsiOrthogonality}
\end{equation}
% Where the subscript $m$ is introduced to $\phi_{j,l}(s)$ and $\psi_{j,l}(s) $ to indicate the $m$th order B-spline scaling and wavelet functions. In the two dimensional case, the convolution integral can be factorised as follows, e.g. 
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.14em}
% \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{!l l }
%  \phi_{m;j,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)\ast \psi^{1}_{m;j,\mathbf{l'}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)&=\left[\phi_{m;j,l_1}\left(s_{1}\right)\ast\phi_{m;j,l'_1}\left(s_{1}\right)\right] \nonumber \\
% &\times \left[ \phi_{m;j,l_2}\left(s_{2}\right) \ast \psi_{m;j,l'_2}\left(s_{2}\right)\right] \nonumber \\
% &
% \end{IEEEeqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% The preceding factorisation can be also applied to the 2D-inner product integral. Non-zero quantities can  be then expressed by
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.14em}
% \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{!l l }
% \left\langle \phi_{m;j,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right),\phi_{m;j,\mathbf{l'}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)\right\rangle &=\left\langle \phi_{m;j,l_1}\left(s_{1}\right),\phi_{m;j,l'_1}\left(s_{1}\right)\right\rangle \nonumber \\
% & \times\left\langle \phi_{m;j,l_2}\left(s_{2}\right) , \phi_{m;j,l'_2}\left(s_{2}\right)\right\rangle \nonumber \\
% &
% \end{IEEEeqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% likewise we can compute 
% $\left\langle  \psi^{1}_{m;j,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right),\psi^{1}_{m;j,\mathbf{l'}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)\right\rangle$
% , \\
% $\left\langle  \psi^{2}_{m;j,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right),\psi^{2}_{m;j,\mathbf{l'}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)\right\rangle$ and \\
% $
% \left\langle \psi^{3}_{m;j,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right), \psi^{3}_{m;j,\mathbf{l'}}\left(s_{1},s_{2}\right)\right\rangle $. \\ \\
In this work, 4th order cardinal B-spline scaling and wavelet functions are used therefore, to compute the integrals (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral1}) and (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral2})  the $8$th and $12$th order B-spline values at integer points are  required and can be found in \cite{Goswami1999}.
\section{Estimation of the Multiresolution Spatio-temporal IDE Model}
A state-space representation of the IDE model allows the use of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm to infer both the kernel and the spatial field from the noise corrupted spatio-temporal data. In this context, the EM algorithm is a two part iterative algorithm that yields the maximum likelihood estimate of the spatial mixing kernel parameters and the posterior distribution of the field weights. In the M-step a lower bound $\mathcal{Q}\left(\boldsymbol\theta,\boldsymbol\theta'\right)$ of the complete-data log-likelihood  $p\left(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y} \mid \boldsymbol\theta \right)$, is maximised under the assumption of the system parameters being $\boldsymbol\theta'$ \cite{McLachlan1997}. In the E-step, given an estimate of $\boldsymbol\theta$, filtering methods can be used to determine the posterior state sequence. Here we compare three techniques namely based on  the Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother \cite{Gibsona2005}, Ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKs) \cite{Evensen2003} and a heuristic separable RTS smoother for state estimation problem. For the first method we modify the framework proposed in \cite{Dewar2009} by computing and storing the required elements prior to the iterative estimation algorithm, the modified algorithm is computationally less demanding (see Appendix \ref{App:ReducedRTS}). In Ensemble Kalman filter (EKf) an ensemble of model states, $\mathbf X_t \in \mathbb R^{n_x \times N} \sim \mathcal N(\mathbf x_t,\mathbf P_t)$ is propogated through the state equation to calculate the forecast estimates $\hat{\mathbf x}^f_t$ and the error covariance of the predicted model state, $\mathbf P_t^f$ where $N$ is the number of ensemble members. Then  the model state is updated to compute analysed estimates, $\hat {\mathbf x}_t^a$.  This is important for model with high dimensional state space where standard Kalman filter  is computationally infeasible to implement as the state covariance matrix needs to be stored and propogated in time. The EnKs updates the filtered ensembles at the current and all prior times every time a new set of measurements becomes available. The algorithm is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:EnKS} for completeness. It is essential that the observations be also treated as an ensemble of random variables, $\mathbf Y_t$, having a distribution with mean equal to the observed value, $\mathbf y_t$ and covariance equal to $\boldsymbol\Sigma_v$ \cite{Houtekamer2005}. 

% represents the predicted state covariance matrix, $\mathbf P_{t|t+1}$ using a large stochastic ensemble of the predicted states $\hat{\mathbf x}_{t+1|t}$.

In the E-step, given an estimate of $\boldsymbol\theta$, the Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother can be employed to determine the posterior state sequence. It can be shown that \cite{Dempster1977,Gibsona2005} every EM iteration increases the lower bound on the likelihood function and hence improving the state and parameter estimates.
% The complexity of this algorithm is $O\left(n_{x}^2n_{\theta}^2\right)+O \left(Tn_{x}^{3}\right)+O\left(Tn_{y}^3\right) $ showing that
\section{Simulation}
This section demonstrates the identification of the proposed IDE model. The MRA of a synthetic model is demonstrated, which is able to represent the system at different spatial scales. The spectral analysis was used to choose the spatial scale adequate to represent the spatial field.

One second of data was generated using equations \eqref{eq:DiscreteTimeModel} and \eqref{eq:ObservationEquation} in response to an initial condition where $\boldsymbol\Sigma_v=0.1 \times \mathbf{I}_{n_y}$ and $ \eta(r-r')=1\times\phi_{4,3,-2}(r-r')$. Sampling time and the synaptic time constant are set to 1 and 10 milliseconds respectively. The sensors were arranged regularly where the distance between adjacent sensors was set to 0.5 mm resulting into 161 observation locations. Sensors are modelled using $\phi_{4,4,k}$, providing a width of 0.8 mm at half the maximum amplitude of the observation kernel, allowing for some cross talk in the recordings. The connectivity kernel and its decomposition are plotted in  \figurename{\ref{fig:KernelAndFreqResponse}} (a). The spatial frequency of the observed field is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:KernelAndFreqResponse}} (b). The observed field has an approximate spatial bandwidth $1.38$ cycles/mm. This suggests the use of wavelets upto level $j=3$. 

% is obtained  and The dynamics associated with the IDE defined by (\ref{eq:1DSimulationKernel}) will be oscillatory and dissipative to initial conditions. The field is decomposed using scaling functions $\phi_{4;0,k} $ and the associated wavelet functions $\psi_{4;j,k} $ with $j=0,1$.

% In order to estimate the spatial mixing kernel and the spatio-temporal field, the  kernel and the field are decomposed using
% Note that the number of translation operations depends on the spatial range of the data. It follows that the total number of terms in (\ref{1DKernelDecompositionForSimulation}) and (\ref{1DFieldDecompositionForSimulation}) are 8 and 47 respectively. The estimated kernel in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate} } is obtained for the cubic B-spline, with initial scale 0 and maximum scale 1. The EM algorithm is allowed to run for 30 iterations to avoid any issues regarding early stopping, though typically the change in $\parallel \mathbf{A} \parallel_{F}$ falls below $10^{-4} $ after less than 15 iterations. A total number of 500 estimation experiments are performed, where $v_t$ and $w_t$ are re-generated each trial.


%  The performance measure employed here is the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) defined as
% \begin{equation}
%  \mathbf{E}\left[\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right) \right]^2ds  \right]
% \label{MISE} 
% \end{equation}
%  where  $e\left(s\right)$ is the error between the unknown function, $f\left( s\right) $ and its estimate, $\hat{f}\left( s\right) $. In this example the original kernel and the field are known and hence the integral in  (\ref{MISE}) can be computed analytically. For spatial mixing kernel we have
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  \lefteqn{\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right)\right]^2ds}\nonumber \\  &=\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)^\top\left[ \int_{\mathcal{S}}\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s\right)\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s\right)^\top ds\right] \left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)&
% \label{MISEKernel}
% \end{eqnarray}
%   Here, we are particularly interested in assessing the performance improvement as the scale of the details in MRA is increased. Performance based on (\ref{MISEKernel}) at different spatial scales and over 500 trials have been evaluated. The MISE of the model at $j=0$ is 0.024 and reduces to 0.005 when $\psi_{4;1,k}$ terms are also included in the model, in fact estimation performance is improved by a factor of 4.8. The coarsest approximation of the kernel along with its approximation at $j=1$ are illustrated in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate}. It can be seen that the model is able to estimate both slowly and rapidly varying segments of the  kernel with very high accuracy.  Field estimates  at a selection of time instants are shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:1DFieldEstimation}}. It is clearly observed that the coarse and fine features of the original field have been captured accurately over regions where observations are available. Observation locations are generated randomly, as shown in \figurename{ \ref{fig:FieldVariance}}. Assuming the observed field can be fully described by the  decomposed IDE model, the variance of the field can be computed to express the  uncertainty of the estimation, at each point in space and at time $t$ we have 
% \begin{equation}
%  \text{Var}(\hat z_t(s_i))=\boldsymbol\mu^{\top}(s_i) \mathbf P_{t|T}\boldsymbol\mu(s_i)
% \label{eq:FieldVariance}
% \end{equation}
% where $\mathbf P_{t|T} $ is the covariance matrix associated with the  state estimates obtained from the RTS smoother. Variance based on (\ref{eq:FieldVariance}) at each spatial location and at $t=50$ is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:FieldVariance}}. The uncertainty of the estimation is higher at almost  every spatial location at $j=1$ compared to $j=0$. This is to be expected as there are more wavelet basis functions at higher resolution and hence more associated weights need to be estimated. Peaks in the variance of the field coincide with regions where no observations have been made. Increasing the number of observation locations, or using equally spaced observation locations would reduce the variance of the field estimation.

% \section{Conclusion}
% A multi-resolution approach to modelling spatio-temporal systems has been presented. This model is able to represent continuous-space, discrete-time dynamics at a number of spatial scales simultaneously. This ability greatly extends the class of system which the Integro-Difference Equation can represent.
% 
% 
% By decomposing both the spatial field and the spatial mixing kernel using a wavelet decomposition, it becomes possible to represent small scale details in the field at the same time as large scale details. This is an essential component of any practical spatio-temporal model, without which the model must be artificially separated into global and local modes a-priori.
% 
% 
% The complexity of the model is not affected by the spatial resolution of the observation process, rather it reflects the underlying complexity of the system under study. Therefore, increasing the resolution at which the system is observed does not necessarily increase the complexity of the system identification problem. However the developed algorithm is sensitive to the state dimension, equivalent to the detail represented in the field, and hence intelligent approaches to reduce the number of basis functions is noted as future work. 
% 
% By considering different levels of decomposition, the proposed approach could be used as a method of determining the appropriate scales of decomposition, within a model-selection framework. Combined with an approach to sparsely modelling spatial heterogeneity, such as boundary conditions, this would allow the application of this work to a real-world data set.

% \begin{lemma}
% Let $N_m\left(s-l_1\right)$ and $N_{m'}\left(s-l_2\right)$ be shifted B-spline functions of order $m$ and $m'$ respectively. Then the inner product of  $N_m\left(s-l_1\right)$  and $N_{m'}\left(s-l_2\right)$ can be calculated by 
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \left\langle N_{m}\left(s-l_{1}\right), N_{m'}\left(s-l_{2}\right)\right\rangle&=&N_{m+m'}\left(m+l_{1}-l_{2}\right) \nonumber \\
% &=&N_{m+m'}\left(m'+l_{2}-l_{1}\right) 
% \end{eqnarray}
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
% \label{lemma:InProduct}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{IEEEproof}
% The support of $N_m\left(s\right)$ is $\left[ 0,m\right]$ and  is symmetric with respect to $s=\frac{m}{2}$, i.e.
% \begin{equation}
%  N_{m}\left(\frac{m}{2}+s\right)=N_{m}\left(\frac{m}{2}-s\right)
% \label{SymmetrySplieEq}
% \end{equation}
% A direct consequence of (\ref{SymmetrySplieEq}) is 
% \begin{equation}
%  N_{m}\left(s\right)=N_{m}\left(m-s\right)

% Therefore
