Modeling:
##########

TransformCoefficients.mat: This file contains required coefficients to write B-spline scaling and wavelet functions in terms of the highest level of approximation in the model, covering j=1 up to j=7. Transformation coefficients for scaling functions and wavelets are stored as TPx and TQx respectively, where x stands for the level of approximation.

BsplineBases.py: Defines B-spline scaling and wavelet functions with convolution and inner product methods.

spline.py: Define 8th and 12th order B-spline functions in order to calculate convolution and inner product of B-spline scaling and wavelet functions.

IDEComponents.py: Defines Integro-Difference Equation neural field model components, Connectivity kernel and the decomposed neural field. It also contains 8th order B-spline calculation in order to compute the convolution of the basis functions. 

NF.py: Defines the neural field model. 

MRIDE.py: Defines decomposed neural field model, imports SKF and ML files for two-stage iterative estimation algorithm.

Estimation:
###########
ML.py: Defines maximum likelihood estimation used in the M-step of the EM based algorithm. 

SKF.py: Defines the  Kalman filter and the  Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother for state estimation


Generate data and implement estimation:
##################################
DataGenerationandEstimation.py: Defines all the parameters and components needed to generate the neural field model and the reduced (state-space) model. It uses the data generated from NF.py to estimate the connectivity kernel parameters estimations in MRIDE.py.

This module imports IDEComponents, BsplineBases, MRIDE and NF.

To run the simulation:

python DataGenerationandEstimation.py
